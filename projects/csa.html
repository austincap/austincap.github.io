<p>I squeezed out the remainder of my shit long ago, but I was sort of stranded there. My phone needed charge and my backup solar charger wasn't cutting it in the torrential downpour that exploded into the sky out of nowhere. The older generation tried to act like these mini-hurricanes were normal. I didn't get why though. We all knew it was global-warming-induced future-weather caused by the unprecedented levels of industrial pollution over the past century. The supermarket bathroom was simply the only place I knew other than my house where I could jack some power. Not that I couldn't afford to pay my bills. For all intents and purposes, I was rich. I really was just after some data. Time isn't happening if information isn't being exchanged. It'd been hours since I last checked reddit. Reddit, while not my favorite infodrug, was definitely the one I used the most. It didn't require a very strong data link, and I never built a tolerance. It was the weed of infodrugs. After I lost feeling in my legs I decided I had enough info in my brain to get me home. I stepped outside the filthy public bathroom with the lone hidden AC outlet in the handicapped stall.</p>

<p>The sky was bright and barren as soon as the rain stopped, like a cartoon on fast-forward. My journey home continued. I still lived amidst the cheap college housing I inhabited before I decided college might be a waste of time. I didn't have a job. When I was still in high school I mined hundreds of bitcoins. I got lucky. It was just a hobby for the most part although I'd be lying if I claimed I wasn't interested in the idea of getting drugs mailed to me. I wasn't the most social person and I always had problems finding dealers. This Silk Road thing solved that problem for me nicely. It seemed like bullshit. Money was not supposed to work like that. Weed was not supposed to be mailed to my apartment with no repercussions. Regrettably the revelation of the rampant spying going on via American alphabet-soup agencies (and my fear of getting caught) outweighed the potential benefits of shitloads of basically free drugs. So I basically forgot about my 679.8378 bitcoin stash. Then, a couple months ago, I happened to come across one of the many articles discussing the recent explosion in bitcoin value. Roughly one thousand USD per bitcoin, just some numbers my computer crunched a couple years ago. I was no millionaire, but I had enough to live on for the rest of my life, easily. How could I live this frugally? Simple.</p>

<p>During my sophomore year of college I became a hikkikomori. And I had never been happier. I grew up in an orphanage so I was sick of face-to-face human interaction by the time I entered college anyway. What people failed to realize is that there are billions of other humans on the internet. I posted my opinions and arguments on the chans, met up in online worlds to play with my steam friends regularly, and played therapist to complete strangers on omegle. The backpages were where I bought all my sex too. At first I only left my room to go to class. Soon though me and most of the people I went to college with realized that it was a waste. Worse than that, it was a scam. I wasn't the first person to stop going to class. I actually held out until about half of my classes were empty. Then I quit right before the end of my sophomore year. Shortly after that I learned of bitcoin's value, cashed out with half a million US dollars, and soon cut off contact with all the people I was forced to interact with to merely exist.</p>

<p>I was almost at my apartment. I passed by swaths of datajunkies swarming like lethargic flies around any free wi-fi point, their faces buried in better worlds at the other end of a screen. Much to my dismay, eye-contact was made and the fluid statue of a man called out to me: &quot;Wizard! Make this spot hot! Allllll I need is a place to code!&quot; A corruption of a 4chan meme run amuck, 'wizard' had become datajunkie slang for someone with a fat dataport. It was derived from &quot;wi-fi&quot; in addition to the mere love of fantasy, it didn't really make sense as time went on with the advent of 5G, the successor to 4G. At 3 gigbits a second nearly anywhere in a 50 mile radius of a tower, it was still considered something of a rich man's luxury. However it was so efficient many ISPs started using a meshnet of 5G access points instead of traditional fiber optic cables, effectively restructuring modern internet. The DJ trying to get my attention could smell the 5G on me and he wasn't satisfied sucking at the distraught teat of the college library's access point. I pretended not to see the guy who carried himself like he was from the West Coast. The dropping out of college thing wasn't merely localized to my school. This had become a nationwide epidemic. Some became hikkikomoris like myself. Some started working on organic farming communes. Some started working for the government. The hippest among us became cyberpunks.</p>

<p>Cyberpunks were traveling, highly educated, homeless, bands of anarchists. Digital nomads on steroids or at least LSD. They were mostly in their twenties and late teens. They carried ample solar chargers, cables, keyboards, camping gear, musical instruments, ramen, and each one's most prized possession, their mobile device, be it smartphone, tablet, or laptop. They traveled in packs of two or three to a couple dozen and never alone. They slept outside in the margins of civilization. They drank the free water that flooded American public facilities. They ate dumpstered food or food acquired via begging or busking or just plain stolen. As much as they rejected society and authority, some even still participated. Not a small amount of cyberpunk troupes had one or two programmers traveling with them. You'd hear the occasional story of a cyberpunk &quot;family&quot; that hit it big after their resident programmer created a viral app. This always shot the code-monkey to maximum alpha status. Even when they had plenty of money, the cyberpunks didn't stop traveling. They were known to merely upgrade their equipment or even buy plane tickets for the whole tribe to continue their travels in a novel environment. They were the drop-out counterpart of the hikkikomori, equally dismissive of society but extroverted by default. They were our generations' counterculture, our hippies, our punks. Revolutionaries at their best and mere junkies at their worst.</p>

<p>I trudged up the stairs and opened the door to my crappy 400 dollar a month studio apartment. A tiny one-room deal with thin walls and no parking. I didn't have a car and I did have considerate neighbors so neither of these things were an issue. I threw down my groceries. I lived off food that didn't require refrigeration. This provided more variety than one would expect. Tortillas, fruit, sausage, parmesan cheese, nuts, dried meat, berries, and that's not even counting canned food. I saved electricity by unplugging my fridge and my temperature was regulated by the layers of clothes I wore and two fans. The only light in the room was the warm, comforting glow of my top-of-the-line custom-built $3,000 computer. I splurged a bit on the black jade desk and blacker leather office chair.</p>

<p>I carefully stepped around all the trash and clothes and wires and sat down to plug in my noise-canceling headphones. I rarely listened to music. I rarely even played vidya these days. My ear buds gave me an additional sense with which I could interact with my comp. For some reason, data transfer to the net produced a quiet clicking. The frequency and pitch of this revealed how much data was being uploaded or downloaded. More than a few times I intuitively realized I had some hidden malware from this sense alone. At the same time I could hear how many and how fast my processors were running by the number and pitch of a simultaneous whirring noise. The percent RAM and GPU use were determined by these two quiet, constant pinging sound sort of like tinnitus. Like everyone else, the little blinking light was still how I determined when the hard disk was being written to. Maybe to someone else this would be annoying, but to me it was soothing as well as mildly practical. I put on my aviator shades. These didn't really connect me to my comp like my stethoscope/headphones. They served the purpose of mitigating eye strain produced by hours and hours of staring at a monitor. Reducing the brightness ironically increased eye strain as it made text more difficult to read.</p>

<p>I set my fingers on the glowing wireless brushed steel mechanical keyboard and lightly fingered the clit-mouse in the center. I started the night with more reddit. I found that the user interface, the mechanism of infodrug ingestion, mattered almost was much as it did for regular chemical drugs. Doing reddit on my desktop was to doing it on my phone as eating pot brownies was to smoking. You had to get a good app to do it on your phone properly too. A poorly formatted interface is fatiguing, the equivalent of body load. Fortunately reddit is a social infodrug making the body load less relevant. If you use, it's only a matter of time before you start participating in the community. This was the opposite of the next infodrug on my itinerary, Netflix. Like heroin, binge watching TV is a pleasant alternative to thinking. On my phone it was like snorting bumps. On my desktop it was like full-on injection. The whole time I was Netflixing my brain was focused on nothing but what I was consuming. I barely moved for 6 hours. When I came out of my tv-binge coma I grabbed my perfectly weighted wireless mouse, in order to mix up the route of administration. I tried some chans after that. 4chan. 420chan. 8chan. Similar to reddit in a lot of ways I always considered these to be the psychedelics of infodrugs. They opened my mind, although I occasionally saw things I didn't really want to see. I went back to reddit. Boredom was no longer a feeling I experienced, similar to how true pain and hunger were nearly eradicated with the invention of anesthesia and cheap food in the 1900s. So long as I had a data connection I could always be indefinitely entertained. Some groups began-</p>

<p>My internal monologue was cut short by a poorly dressed, hairy caveman, clenching a pen and moleskine notebook in his teeth, kicking open my unlocked door. Tan and short and muscular and lean. He had these massive, wireless headphones on and was listening to some music with more bass than they could handle. I got the impression he hailed from a cyberpunk clan. </p>

<p>I felt no fear though. I had lived a good life. And I wasn't afraid of death. I watched tons of anime, surfed the net compulsively, and been around quite a few people on drugs so nothing struck me as particularly unusual anymore. I took a pic of him with my phone and used this app that auto-sent it to the chans, reddit, diaspora, instagram, facebook, tumblr, and more as others shared it. Caption: 'this guy just broke into my house'</p>

<p>He took the notebook out of his mouth and quickly scribbled a note with its attached pen: 'i need help' and underneath it 'DEAF-MUTE sorry' I snapped another pic updating my threads. I took off my headphones expecting him to do the same but he didn't. Oh well. I tried to grab his pad to write a note but it was back in his mouth before I could attempt the maneuver. I motioned for him to come over to watch me as I typed in a new text document: 'I can't help you. I'm sorry. Please leave.'</p>

<p>He scribbled on his notepad again: 'Im on a quest and I need a wizard.'</p>

<p>His brown eyes seemed sort of dilated and he was clearly on drugs. The chemical kind, not the info kind. The kind I used to do. I was bored enough to think at the time: Why not humor him? What&rsquo;s the worst that could happen?</p>

<p>I typed: 'you have chosen well. Here is your armor faithful warrior'</p>

<p>I scavenged a heavy leather jacket and some beaten-up steel-toed boots from my laundry/carpet. They didn't quite fit but he seemed ecstatic. I gathered my phone, keys, and wallet. I actually had a hiking stick in my closet, clearly making me a wizard, so I duct-taped it to a tazer. In case this drugged up stranger tried something. I scanned the room one last time for &quot;spells&quot; to take. The best I could come up with was my large-pocket-sized computer air duster. A cold spell? A wind spell? Whatever this is a joke anyway, I thought. I typed: Are you ready to embark? He pressed a single key on my keyboard: 'y'</p>

<p>He started running out of my room down the stairs. Taking them two at a time. I barely kept his pace as we raced down the street, the deaf-mute caveman still holding the notebook in his mouth (I noticed his clothes had no pockets). He ran like a robot or a Cold War portrayal of a Russian, looking straight ahead at all times. We ran through campus and traversed the miniature hills and valleys of a golf course. Under nothing but street lights and a cloudy night sky. We reached the edge of the woods. The music in his headphones got slower. He took the notepad out of his mouth and wrote: 'wiz use light spell'</p>

<p>I flicked on the tazer's flashlight switch at the end of my wizard staff. Nice touch on calling it a light spell. This guy was really high. We entered the forest. I let him lead and I tried my best to illuminate the ground around both of us. My phone beeped. As I cast 'silent' I noticed I had 19 total notifications (comments, upvotes, likes, etc) from my recent multi-post on various social media apps. Not bad for 10 minutes. It's hard to remember exactly why I continued at this point. Sure it was partly because I was on the best endorphin high I'd had in years. And yeah I probably needed some excitement in my life or at least some exercise. Also maybe I possessed more than a twinge of nihilism. But oddly enough I think I really was just nostalgic for going on these adventures with my friends as a kid. Plus I had the advantage of the tazer at the end of a stick.</p>

<p>I was already tired from the jog and the walk through these pitch dark woods was boring. Right before I was about to give up on our quest we had our first random encounter. The loud barking startled me and I hung back but our fearless hero seemed unfazed. I managed to follow his path with my light and turn on my video-GIF recorder as he charged straight at the sickly beast giving it a devastating kick to the ribs. No shoes either. He punched another dog out of the air that jumped at him. He growled at them both through his notebook and another two that were too cowardly to make a move. His efforts proved successful, and the dogs ran away. He was bleeding.</p>

<p>&quot;Holy crap dude! You okay?&quot;</p>

<p>He calmly wrote with a big grin: &lsquo;99/100&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now I was in this thing for the long haul. That was just too freaking cool. I uploaded the GIF.</p>

<p>&quot;Jesus. How much XP you get?&quot;</p>

<p>He pointed to his headphones and I quickly typed out my question. He wrote: '12 but we have to share lol'</p>

<p>I tapped on my phone: 'As long as you're okay... What is the goal of this quest anyway?'</p>

<p>With my flashlight shining at his chin, he looked me dead in the eye as he wrote (poorly) and showed to me: 'kill the net'</p>

<p>I shrugged implying that he needed to be more specific. He moved away from the flashlight a little dejected and spent a few moments writing out something. He showed me his writing impatiently: 'tonight were gonna shut down the 5G cell tower. weve already lost too many of our tribe to the hivemind'</p>

<p>It was initially confusing to see a cyberpunk write about shutting down the net although I immediately understood what he was talking about. I couldn't deny that the net had turned me into a datajunkie. The scourge that morphed me into a zombie was spreading faster throughout society than any chemical drug ever could, thanks to the low cost and high accessibility. The internet was evil. There was just one problem. It took an awkward several seconds of typing but I finally presented my strange companion with: 'I lack the skill necessary. Do you even have a plan?'</p>

<p>He looked at me, flashed a smile, and scrawled: 'we are the chosen ones! and as a wizard you have a 5G connection. just download this when were at the place. copy it, dont link to it yet'</p>

<p>From his notebook he quickly produced a disgusting, crumpled paper QR code, the highest resolution I'd ever seen. I stared at it for a second before mechanically getting it prepped for taking it into my phone. Ignoring his wishes in my personal quest for points I sent it to the net with the caption: '#shutdownthenet' Right after the upload completed I was a bit stunned to find that since I checked a couple minutes prior I had already reached 112 collective notifications. This guy was karma gold. I had my doubts that he wasn't just crazy though.</p>

<p>I made a lead the way gesture and we continued until we got to a partially collapsed abandoned building in the middle of the woods. The full moon's light came in through the giant hole in the structure and glinted off something inside. Soon after we carefully entered, a vagrant lunged at me with a machete but my friend took the brunt of the poorly executed blow...receiving only about 5 damage. I used lightning bolt until our attacker stopped moving. The warrior took the sword and handed me the hat. I let him have the flask of health potion we found. Being the only one with pockets I took the bag of nickels and dimes. I didn't take a pic of this scene but checked my score again: 319 notifications. Like a samurai, I switched off my tazer in one elegant motion. The moonlight was good enough that I could switch off the light too as we pressed on all the way into some rich guy's backyard.</p>

<p>The blonde barbarian dropped into a crouch and began making every step deliberate, so that the initial contact with the ground was with a force of zero gradually increasing over time. I followed suit. We were almost at the exit gate when a police car pulled up dousing us in light. The man who got out didn't seem to be a cop. He had a gun though. He shouted at us, &quot;What the hell are you doing on my property? Take off your damn headphones!&quot;</p>

<p>I pushed my teammate back and made my move before he could do anything stupid. I held up my staff apologetically and said in my most sycophantic voice, &quot;We're LARPing sir. We got too drunk and somehow we ended up here. We don't want any trouble. You can search us. We're not thieves, just drunk college kids. Swear to god sir. Please.&quot; I ribbed my oddly dressed friend and he thankfully seemed to get the picture without hearing a word. He looked down, intentionally started swaying a bit, took his writing implements out of his mouth, and proceeded to dry heave until he puked.</p>

<p>The man with the gun (who I quickly ascertained from his car was a currently off-duty sheriff) lowered his firearm and eyed us suspiciously. &quot;Why you got that sword then boy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We're LARPing, live action role playing. We're pretending that we're wizards and warriors. Feel it, it's not even sharp.&quot; It wasn't.</p>

<p>The sheriff seemed to be buying it. &quot;What in god's name is wrong with you boys? My son does this crap too. You needa be hanging out with girls. You're in college for chrissakes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sir, do with us what you wish. Just know that we really, really mean no harm and we're just trying to get home at this point. I'm tired. He's trashed. You can take our stuff. Just please don't arrest us. We really, really were just trying to cut through your yard. We're lost.&quot;</p>

<p>He grabbed my lightning rod and the machete, then stared us down. &quot;Yer damn right yer lost. You all boys know that's trespassing, right? I could send you down to the station right now and lock you in the drunk tank for the weekend...but I don't think you'd last 10 minutes in there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No sir. Please. We wouldn't last 5 minutes.&quot;</p>

<p>He glared at the warrior for a solid 3 seconds before finally saying, &quot;Okay. I'm still gonna write you a ticket, but it's justa warning. This is ONLY cause I wanna go to sleep.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you so much sir!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm keeping these...&quot; he held up our weapons, &quot;...toys. If you want 'em back you'll hafta come down to the station.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ok no problem. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Have a good night!&quot;</p>

<p>We stood there for several beats in silence.</p>

<p>&quot;Well? What are you waiting for? Fuck off!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about our tickets?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't worry about it! Call a cab and fuck off!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you so much!&quot;</p>

<p>I tugged the arm of the fake-drunk real-tripping warrior and we headed off down the dirt driveway as I pulled out my phone to call a cab. Turned out I'd already hit 7,590 notifications! This had to be a new record for me. After the sheriff seemed to go inside the warrior was back to his normal weird self. He quickly jotted down: 'glad thats over. Were not done yet tho'</p>

<p>This had gone on long enough plus my only defense against this insane human being was gone forever. The internet points were nice but I'm never trying to die. I typed in my phone: 'dude I'm sorry, I'm out. I'm calling a cab if you want to go somewhere else'</p>

<p>Squinting in the moonlight he wrote down: 'No! We need you wizard. It has to be you.'</p>

<p>I ignored him and tried calling myself a black-cab via Uber. The man on the other end said it would take him 20 minutes to get to me. I plopped down cross-legged and admired my 9,721 notifications for a while afraid that.</p>

<p>The warrior (still standing) handed me a note: 'I dont know why it has to be you but they are always right. They. The voices.' He tapped his still-erupting-music headphones when I looked up at him, then he handed me another note: 'They found me in a hospital. I don't remember anything before that. I think I was in an accident. I know where we can go tho'</p>

<p>I texted him angrily: 'Dude. I can't actually help you. Find someone else.'</p>

<p>He stared at my phone's screen for a second before letting out the most agonizing shrieks. Then as quickly as he started screaming, he stopped, although he didn't stop shaking. His trembling hands scrawled another note in broken handwriting: 'I need you'</p>

<p>My empathy kicked in. What could I do? I couldn't let this guy suffer and he no longer seemed completely crazy. Someone was doing this weird shit to him. Equally important, they seemed to want something with me. I looked at my phone again to find I broke 10,000 notifications. I stood up and typed: 'ok man, lead the way'</p>

<p>He grinned weakly and fought his pain prior to sprinting off in that artificial manner yet again. We must have jogged about three miles away from civilization. Right before I collapsed we reached a drainage tunnel. He climbed in. I cast light with my phone and reluctantly followed, even though it was big enough for us to walk comfortably side by side. There was tons of graffiti and the whole passageway was littered with spraycans. We soon came upon a decorated canvas barricade that the warrior pushed aside to reveal a large open room lit by the cool glow of LED-in-gallon-water-jug lanterns. Pipes neatly poured out water from multiple levels. My eyes were drawn to the crowd surrounding an industrial-size Biolite woodfire grill/generator. The warrior's cyberpunk tribe.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey guys!&quot; I shouted to a confused response. The warrior ignored me and went to hug and hand-slap his friends. I stood back letting my eyes adjust. It was actually quite cozy. Chains of carefully arranged garbage. A waterwheel generator powering a couple low-spec laptops. And every single one of the warrior's friends had different over-ear headphones. I stood there staring at not just how fantastical my environment was, but how much these people loved each other. How happy they were living in this little tribe in the sewer. I wasn't envious. It was more about observing cyberpunks in their natural habitat than me wishing I was one of them. It was odd how fit and healthy the seemed despite their condition. Like a good nature documentarian, I made sure to snap some pics and upload them, caption: '#cyberpunklyfe'. At this time I had reached 21,314 notifications.</p>

<p>They all wrote and exchanged some notes. They all seemed equally mute, yet it seemed like none of them knew sign language. After a couple minutes of this I was beckoned over and they embraced me. Some women came out from one of the tunnels dripping water holding apparently dumpstered food and a couple cases of beer. We sat at a stolen picnic table and dug in. They passed notes full of small talk to me and I passed responses back. We roasted marshmallows over the Biolite. It was a strange experience to say the least. After a while a guy who had an air of authority pointed to a watch and the warrior got up. It was time to go. I got to participate in the hug-fest this time. The warrior was given a lockpick kit and I was given a zippo lighter along with a note that read: 'it's dangerous to go alone. take this' I found it odd they didn't give us anything else because they clearly had a small stockpile of guns, swords, and even a morning star. I pointed and the warrior just shook his head in response. I noticed he no longer was carrying his notebook and pen. We were getting close to the final boss. Without missing a beat, we were off down the exit tunnel and the dull glow of the cyberpunk camp was soon extinguished by distance.</p>

<p>Some cockroaches scurried past but they thankfully weren't trying to attack. Turned out the rats were. The warrior started wielding a piece of rubble to little effect. At first I tried to run (leaving my friend without light) but the warrior's screams returned, freezing me in my tracks. Time seemed to slow down when I shined the light back on him. I patted my pockets. My wallet, my computer duster, my keys, the lighter... In a flash of insight I grabbed a nearly empty spraycan and cast flame. It rewarded me with the crunches and screams of dead cockroaches. I picked up another and headed towards my shrieking friend. While no rats were killed, it was more than enough to scare almost all of them off my fellow LARPer. All except one. A real life unintimidated rat-king. I sent a pic of it to the net, caption: #the1trueking. It sort of resisted my next fire attack but it couldn't avoid a crushing blow from the warrior's stone. He didn't stick around to finish it off. We continued running down the tunnel. I checked my phone: 82,327 notifications.</p>

<p>It got narrower and narrower until we finally squeezed out one after the other into a dangerously wealthy neighborhood. A gated community. Cameras everywhere and the whole couple of drunk college kids thing wouldn't get us out of trouble here. I typed on my phone: 'dude we need to find another path to the place. we could seriously get arrested'</p>

<p>He looked at me, looked down, then turned around to continue on. I should have just let him go on his way. Instead I grabbed him and tried to take off his headphones. They were stuck to his head. He allowed me to investigate. Turned out that under his mop of hair this poor, crazy fucker had superglued his headphones to his skull. Easily undone but still, what the fuck? What did they do to him?</p>

<p>Before I could even process this, lights silently pulled up. Police. We both started running. The car sped up but I managed to find a nook to hide in, yet the warrior was gone. Perfect. Gunshots. I carefully scanned the surrounding area to make sure there weren't any cameras, peeked my head out, and sure enough, the technophobic cyberpunk was charging the car. He ripped open the door, threw the apparently stunned cop on the ground, yanked out a knife in the cop's boot, and severely severed his throat. I wasn't close enough to get the full brunt of the image, but the gurgling of his screams through the bloody gash that was the cop's trachea was enough to momentarily paralyze me in disgust or fear or something. I watched as the silhouette of the murderer rummaged through the still flashing cop car. He ran over to me wielding a shotgun and carrying a first aid kit. Without thinking I put my hands up. He handed me a note he must have scrawled with the cop's blood-spattered notepad: 'were ok we just need to get to the 5G base station. I need to cast heal on these bite wounds. You cast teleport'</p>

<p>I reached for the first aid kit but he pulled away and got in the car. I wanted to give up. I turned to my phone reflexively seeking infodrugs; to enter that better world. 167,215 notifications. I shouldn't have been this nice. I should have bailed at the homeless guy. But it was past the time for regrets. No going back once you're an accomplice to a cop-killer. I got in the drivers seat and figured out how to turn off the lights. The warrior guided me with pointing and deaf-style yelling in between treating his wounds. The local 5G tower base station ended up being only a five minute drive outside of the gated community, thankfully not passing any traffic cameras. Still night. I distracted the lone guard with a fireblast and the warrior cast shotgun. We worked our way through the dark, silent facility until we got to what the cursed warrior seemed to think was the central control room.</p>

<p>After a few minutes of failed attempts at lockpicking, my video game instincts caused me to take out the ice spell to freeze the lock and the warrior blasted the door open. We were in. Cops were surely on their way already so I got straight to work. I downloaded the file off the QR code and it installed on my phone automatically before prompting a restart. When it booted back up my phone was something else. Green Matrix-like text was constantly scrolling on the background and there were two buttons on the screen, 'SCAN' and 'KILL' underneath it. I instinctively hit the green SCAN button first, which presumably took in all information necessary to manipulate the system via a probe into the base station's intranet. This process took 5 agonizing minutes. No cops though. The warrior was content to happily do push-ups as we waited. My eyes were darting from the nearby computer terminal to my occupied phone longing for some juicy data to take in. I hadn't had 5 minutes to be left with my thoughts in a long time. It sucked.</p>

<p>As soon as the bar was filled, the KILL button turned from red to green and I hit it. At first I wasn't sure it worked, then all screens shut off leaving my phone the remaining source of light. It stayed alive just long enough for me to see the notification total from the most recent update: 553,140. Finally there were just the quietly blinking red, blue, and green LEDs on my compatriot's headphones. It was almost peaceful for about 3 seconds.</p>

<p>Then there were police lights and sirens. Then a loud crash. Then explosions. The warrior led the way outside, shotgun first. Before I could get a good visual of the battle, the shotgun warrior launched a metal pellet hurricane in their general direction. He bolted off to the van the headphoned-cyberpunks shooting and morning-starring the cops must have arrived in, deliberately ripping his headphones off his head in the process. There was blood and bone but it didn't look as horrific as what I braced myself for. Before I could even close my door we peeled out spraying gravel everywhere. I initially kept my head down to avoid the bullets and stayed there at the warrior's behest.</p>

<p>We rode in silence for a while until I heard, &quot;I didn't lose my memory.&quot; The warrior spoke. I was silent. He took a deep breath and continued speaking in his surprisingly normal voice.</p>

<p>&quot;That stuff about the voices was bullshit too. We really were deaf-mute though! Me, my friends in the sewer, we were all in the marines. I can't speak for them, but I was not a good soldier. I was really only there cause I had nowhere else to go.&quot; He gripped the wheel a little tighter. &quot;The day before I was to ship out to Iran the brass pulled me aside and told me I wasn't going to war. At first I assumed it was just cause I couldn't shoot for shit.&quot; He briefly turned to me with a sad grin. &quot;My dexterity stat was low.&quot; I let out a polite snort. &quot;Anyway, it was really all about brain implant experiments. Top secret stuff. Project HIVEMIND is what I heard a few times. I don't know what the ultimate goal was, I just know that they controlled me like a drone.&quot;</p>

<p>Before he could continue I interrupted him. &quot;What the motherfuckin- Holy shit- Dude. I think I've heard of something like that. Like those Chinese robo-roaches?&quot;</p>

<p>He grimaced a bit and I felt a twinge of guilt. &quot;Yeah, like those cockroaches,&quot; he answered. &quot;Being a marine sucked but the shit they did to me lab...&quot; A nearly imperceptible shudder punctuated his thousand yard stare. &quot;I could only obey the commands they gave. Beamed through 5G one of the guys from the sewer learned. There were side-effects, or maybe it was intentional. They deactivated the hearing and talking parts of my brain. Then one day, there was some sort of outage and the tower musta shut down. I could hear again. I was free. Then I escaped. Others apparently had the same idea. And the rest you know.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What was with the headphones? I thought you couldn't hear? And how'd you get that QR code?&quot; I had a few more questions but I could piece the answers together. They needed me cause I was the only societal drop-out with a 5G connection in a 50 mile radius. We took that convoluted route to avoid traffic cameras. They located me via my extensive online presence, and that possibly contributed to all the video game analogies too. They knew my weakness.</p>

<p>He parked the car. I didn't notice but he had driven me back to my complex. He killed the lights and looked at me. &quot;After we escaped and the power came back on, we still were under their control. We couldn't rip that shit outta our heads when we tried. Luckily one of the girls tried putting on a pair of headphones she found. It seemed to block the signal entirely so long as music was playing giving us our free will back, although talking and hearing were still out of commission. We only started gluing them on for safety last month. Another one of us stole the QR code for the 5G killswitch during our escape.&quot; His face exuded bittersweet as he looked towards my apartment door. &quot;And now, it's finally over.&quot; With the same expression, he turned back to me. &quot;Now I got a question for you. Why'd you help me?&quot;</p>

<p>I finally could admit the real answer to myself. Loneliness. I hadn't talked to anyone in person in months, not even a cashier. I too had become a deaf-mute controlled by cell towers...albeit in a less extreme manner. Maybe I knew that subconsciously when he busted in earlier that night. Maybe I-</p>

<p>My overwrought introspection was broken as I realized my phone's GPS was tracking my location the whole time before I induced the 5G outage. There weren't any cameras at my apartment. I could tell police this crazy guy kicked down my door and stole my phone. Why would any sane, wealthy person go on an adventure with a total stranger like that? I had plausible deniabilty so long as I stuck to my story. I could actually get away with this, if I gave up half a million internet points. A hard choice to say the least. Reason prevailed in the end though.</p>

<p>Without another word I dropped my phone in the car, got out, and went straight to my computer to scroll my mouse wheel on a blank monitor.</p>

  <p>The ultimate goal of Personanexus is to create parallels between all the different ways to categorize people and personalities. Check out the adjacent pic courtesy of Cracked. The ninja turtle Leonardo is the leader of his group. He's even-tempered and ambitious. This "leader-of-4" trope is seen everywhere from Scooby Doo to Seinfeld to real-life groups like The Beatles to the 4 temperaments of Hippocrates. Personanexus takes this a step further by enabling comparisons to be drawn between different "persona groups" with dissimilar numbers of "personas." It's fun to put people into boxes. From astrology to personality psychology to 'which Sex &amp; the City character are you?' type quizzes, a certain segment of the population has always been drawn this.</p>
